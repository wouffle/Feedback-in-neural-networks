The inspiration for this project comes from the desire to understand and demonstrate the capabilities of Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) in handling sequential data. Predicting the next value in a sine wave sequence is a classic problem that highlights the strength of RNNs in capturing temporal dependencies. This project aims to provide a simple, yet effective, example of how RNNs can be applied to real-world time series data, making the concept accessible to beginners in machine learning and neural networks. By focusing on a sine wave, the project ensures a clear and understandable introduction to sequence prediction.
