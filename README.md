Simple RNN for Sine Wave Prediction

This repository contains a simple example of using a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) with TensorFlow and Keras to predict the next value in a sine wave sequence.

Overview

The code demonstrates how to generate sequential data, prepare it for training, build and train a SimpleRNN model, and make predictions using the trained model. The primary goal is to predict the next value in a sine wave sequence.

Requirements

Python 3.6+

TensorFlow 2.x
